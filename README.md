# Chiptune.js
#### Version 2

This is a javascript library that can play module music files. It is based on the [libopenmpt](https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt) C/C++ library. To translate libopenmpt into Javascript [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) was used. For audio output inside the browser WebAudio API is used.

**Please note**: The compiled `libopenmpt.js` in this repository is based on an outdated version of libopenmpt. Newer versions contain bugfixes and other improvements. Download the latest version from the libopenmpt developers [here](https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/download/) and replace `libopenmpt.js.mem` and `libopenmpt.js`.  
If you prefer to compile `libopenmpt.js` yourself (to save space or make custom changes) follow the instructions in the "Development" section.

## Features

* Play all tracker formats supported by libopenmpt (including mod, xm, s3m, it)
* Simple Javascript API
* Pause/Resume
* Tested with Google Chrome and Firefox
* Play local (HTML5) and remote files (XHR)
* Stereo playback
* Module metadata
* Looping mode
 
## To do

* Playback information (e.g. position, speed, bpm)
* Mixer settings (e.g. sampling rate, resolution)
* Seekbar support
 
## Demo

See it in action [here](https://deskjet.github.io/chiptune2.js/).

Just drop a module (e.g. from [modarchive.org](https://modarchive.org)) on the demo page and enjoy.

## Development
Download the latest [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) SDK. Follow the instructions for your OS. Make sure `emcc` and `em++` commands are available in the PATH.  
Next download and extract the libopenmpt source code (unix like) from https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/.  
Use this command inside the libopenmpt source folder to build:

    make CONFIG=emscripten

If it compiles successfully these files (and a few more) will be created in the `bin` directory:

1. `libopenmpt.js` is libopenmpt compiled to JavaScript.
2. `libopenmpt.js.mem` is the memory initialization file `libopenmpt.js` will download/require it when loaded.
3. `libopenmpt_test.js` (and `libopenmpt_test.j.mem`) is the libopenmpt test suite and can be run in NodeJS.

Only the first two files are needed for chiptune2.js.

### Building Stylesheet
The stylesheet is built with [SASS+Compass](http://compass-style.org/). To build this yourself, follow the Compass [installation instructions](http://compass-style.org/install/), then change into the chiptune2.js directory and use this command:

    compass watch

The stylesheet .css file with rebuild every time you make a change to the source file in the `sass` folder.
